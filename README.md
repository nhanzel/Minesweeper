# Minesweeper
### Nathan Hanzel
#### Made using HTML/CSS/Javascript/AJAX

This project is a full fledged minesweeper game in the browser.

**Some notes on the code**

> There is a user authentication system built into the code that relies on a POST call to a web server to get a password. This can be commented out if desired, but this was my rudimentary attempt at including user auth. Including this feature was mostly to show how AJAX can be used for user autherization.

> Some features of classic minesweeper that aren't included are a recursive function that activates all adjacent neighbors of a 0 cell when clicked, and ensuring that the first cell you click isn't a mine. If you clone this repo, feel free to mess around with the code and add these features.
